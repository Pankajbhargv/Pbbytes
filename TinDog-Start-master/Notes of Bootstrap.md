Notes of Bootstrap
Basically boostrap is a framework or library which is used to provide the adaptive layout to the user
The code has been already included in the keyboard.
This is best time to make it more interestings and that  
The full form of cdn is content delievery network and this provides the closest server to the user
For example if the server is in US and a person sitting in India try to fetch the result from server then CDN will try to provide the result 
to the closest server. SO that it does not have to travel a long distance.
There are several ways to install bootstrap package but the best idea is to include the link description so that the website will take directly to the site where bootstrap has its all files
